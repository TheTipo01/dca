# DCA

 Simple alpine docker image containing just the DCA executable, ready to be used. 
 Made to speed up my [music bot](https://github.com/TheTipo01/YADMB) docker image building

 You can find the image on:
 - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/thetipo01/dca)
 - [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/thetipo01/dca)
 - [Github packages](https://github.com/TheTipo01/dca/pkgs/container/dca)
